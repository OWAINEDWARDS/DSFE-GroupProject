# Title/Question : Analysing Planitary data to find likely candidates for potential/ likely planet habitability.
## DSFE-GroupProject - UoB

### Data Source/Sources: 
- https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/open-exoplanet-catalogue/version/2

# Our Idea:

We plan to use our knowledge of what makes our planet habitable, i.e, escape velocity, surface temperature; The distance from the star; eccentricity of orbit; mass of the planet and other characteristics to determine which exoplanets in the data set could hold potential for life by, analysing similar data about earth. We could pick out the most likely planets within the .csv file and conclude and present other data about them.
